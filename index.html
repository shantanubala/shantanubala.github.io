                <h2>Somatic Labs</h2>
                <p>Somatic Labs exists to create devices capable of augmenting consciousness by ensuring the salience of important information. Through haptics, we can discreetly convey large streams of information without introducing visual or auditory distractions. Such technology can not only provide more engaging user experiences, but can also assist individuals adjusting to a disability or recovering from an injury.</p>
                <h3>Somatic Pulse</h3>
                <p>Codenamed "Pulse," Somatic Labs' first product is a bluetooth-enabled wrist band that stimulates the surface of a user's skin in patterns according to the notifications received on their smartphone. A smartwatch without the extra screen.</p>

                <p>Haptics.js is a simple JavaScript library that allows you to implement vibrotactile effects using the HTML5 implementation of <em>navigator.vibrate()</em>. In addition to providing a cross-browser compatibility layer, Haptics.js allows you to quickly create different vibrotactile effects, including fading vibrations, heartbeats, notifications, and error alerts.</p>
